# DiscordDndBot
A personal Project dreamt up from transistioning from hosting DnD in person to online
over discord to help with the difficulties of online.This project uses two major api's to assist in the development of this project.

# Discordpy
I use this library as this projects goal is a bot that is available for use on discord and is publicly available for use to anyone with the ability to add it to their respective servers

# D&D 5e API
I utilized this public API(http://www.dnd5eapi.co/) for the minimum core game data that the bot could use.

# Technology Summary
Windows 10, VSCode, Python - Version(3.8.2), Discordpy(https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html), and the 5e API(http://www.dnd5eapi.co/)

# Future Additions
