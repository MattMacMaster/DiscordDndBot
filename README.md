# DiscordDndBot
Just a personal project and the first of many discord bots to come.

Using python and the discord library, as well as git and guthub for version management'
#TODO going to add migration scripts to create a no_SQL database that hosts all homebrew creations and allows them to be requested via the command system

For Deployment, will be porting this over to a raspberry pi that will host this bot 24/7
